## Introduction

Wireshark is a powerful network protocol analyzer that allows you to capture and inspect the data traveling back and forth on a network. This repository serves as a platform to showcase my proficiency in using Wireshark for network analysis, packet decoding, and troubleshooting. The labs included here highlight my ability to analyze network protocols, diagnose issues, and gain insights into network behavior.

The labs in this repository cover a wide range of network scenarios and use cases. By working through these labs, you will develop practical skills in using Wireshark to dissect network traffic, decode protocols, analyze packet contents, and identify potential network problems.

## Repository Structure

The Wireshark Labs Repository is organized into the following sections:

1. **Basic Packet Analysis**: This section covers fundamental Wireshark usage. You will find labs on capturing packets, applying display filters, analyzing basic protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS), and interpreting packet details.

2. **Advanced Protocol Analysis**: Here, you will find labs that delve into more complex protocols. Topics include analyzing secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSH), working with VoIP protocols, and examining network behavior during different types of attacks.

3. **Troubleshooting Scenarios**: This section focuses on using Wireshark to troubleshoot network issues. You will explore labs related to diagnosing slow network performance, identifying network congestion, and pinpointing sources of packet loss.

4. **Security Analysis**: In this section, you will encounter labs involving security analysis with Wireshark. This could include detecting suspicious patterns, analyzing potential security breaches, and identifying anomalies in network traffic.

5. **Wireless Network Analysis**: Here, you will find labs specific to analyzing wireless network traffic using Wireshark. Topics may include capturing wireless packets, examining Wi-Fi protocols, and troubleshooting wireless network issues.
